## Client-Server : ls & cat
### Windows multithreading app

The application imitates the **ls** and **cat** commands from the Unix Shell terminal 

**server.exe** is run with 2 parameters , the first being the directory we are currently in (used as reference director in the **ls** command) and the second represents the number of threads the server should run on.

#### Both commands are represented as integers :

***ls** - 1
***cat** -2
